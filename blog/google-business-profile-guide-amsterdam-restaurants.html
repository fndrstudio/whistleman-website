              <p>Quick question. When someone types "best brunch near Vondelpark" into Google, does your restaurant show up?</p>

              <p>If you had to think about that for more than two seconds, keep reading.</p>

              <p>Your Google Business Profile is one of the most powerful free marketing tools available to any hospitality business. And yet, most restaurants and bars in Amsterdam treat it like an afterthought. A quick logo upload, maybe an address, and then they forget it exists.</p>

              <p>That's a massive missed opportunity. Here's how to fix it.</p>

              <h2>Why Your Google Business Profile Matters More Than You Think</h2>

              <p>When people search for restaurants, bars, or cafes in Amsterdam, Google Maps is almost always the first place they look. Not Instagram. Not your website. Google Maps.</p>

              <p>Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is what shows up in those results. It's your digital storefront before anyone walks through your actual door. And Google uses the information on your profile to decide whether to show your business to people searching nearby.</p>

              <p>Here's what makes this even more interesting: we audited the Google Business Profiles of several social media agencies in Amsterdam, and almost none of them are posting updates to their own profiles. That means the playing field is wide open. If you start using GBP actively, you're already ahead of most competitors.</p>

              <h2>Setting Up Your Profile the Right Way</h2>

              <p>If you haven't claimed your Google Business Profile yet, do it today. Go to business.google.com and follow the verification process. It takes about a week. Once you're verified, here's what to fill out:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Business name:</strong> Use your exact business name. Don't stuff keywords in here. "Caf&eacute; de Jordaan" is correct. "Caf&eacute; de Jordaan Best Coffee Amsterdam Netherlands" is not, and Google may penalise you for it.</li>
                <li><strong>Category:</strong> Choose the most specific primary category available. "Brunch restaurant" is better than just "restaurant." You can add up to nine secondary categories too.</li>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> You have 750 characters. Use them. Include what makes your place special, what kind of food you serve, and where you're located. Write naturally but include relevant terms like your neighbourhood name and cuisine type.</li>
                <li><strong>Hours:</strong> Keep these updated. Wrong hours are the fastest way to earn a one-star review from someone who showed up to a closed door.</li>
                <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Upload at least 10 high-quality images: your interior, your food, your team, and the view from the street so people can find you. Businesses with photos get 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps.</li>
                <li><strong>Menu:</strong> Add your menu. You can upload it as a PDF or add items individually. People searching for restaurants want to see what you serve before they visit.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Optimising Your Listing for Maximum Visibility</h2>

              <p>Getting found on Google Maps isn't random. Google uses three main factors to rank local businesses:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> How well your profile matches what someone is searching for. This is why your categories, description, and posts matter.</li>
                <li><strong>Distance:</strong> How close you are to the person searching. You can't change this, but you can make sure your address is accurate.</li>
                <li><strong>Prominence:</strong> How well-known and reputable your business is online. Reviews, website links, and consistent information across the web all contribute.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>To improve your ranking, focus on what you can control: a complete profile, regular updates, and a steady flow of reviews.</p>

              <h2>The Power of Google Posts (And Why Almost Nobody Uses Them)</h2>

              <p>This is the biggest opportunity most Amsterdam hospitality businesses are sleeping on. Google Posts are free mini-updates that appear directly on your business listing. Think of them like Instagram posts, but for Google.</p>

              <p>You can share updates, events, offers, and new menu items. Each post appears for seven days and can include an image, text, and a call-to-action button.</p>

              <p>Here's how to use them effectively:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Post weekly:</strong> Consistency matters. One post per week keeps your listing fresh and signals to Google that your business is active.</li>
                <li><strong>Use strong images:</strong> A photo of your new seasonal cocktail will perform better than a stock photo of a generic glass.</li>
                <li><strong>Include keywords naturally:</strong> If you're a wine bar in the Jordaan, mention "wine bar" and "Jordaan" in your post. Don't force it, just work it into natural language.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a CTA:</strong> Every post should include a clear action: "Book a table," "Call us," "View our menu." Make it easy for people to take the next step.</li>
                <li><strong>Share events:</strong> Hosting a wine tasting at your canal-side spot? A live DJ on Friday? Post it. Event posts get extra visibility in Google Search.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>We checked, and currently, the vast majority of restaurants and bars in Amsterdam are not posting to their Google Business Profiles. That means every post you publish is essentially uncontested real estate in your local search results.</p>

              <h2>How to Get More Reviews (Without Being Awkward About It)</h2>

              <p>Reviews are the single biggest factor in how your business appears on Google Maps. More reviews and higher ratings push you higher in results and make people more likely to choose you.</p>

              <p>Here's how to build your review count naturally:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Create a direct review link:</strong> Google lets you generate a short link that takes people straight to the review form. Print it on a card, add it to your receipt, or include it in a follow-up email.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask at the right moment:</strong> The best time to ask for a review is when someone just had a great experience. Train your staff to mention it during checkout or at the end of a meal.</li>
                <li><strong>Respond to every review:</strong> Every single one. Good reviews get a thank you. Bad reviews get a calm, professional response. Google notices that you're engaged, and potential customers see that you care.</li>
                <li><strong>Never buy reviews:</strong> Google is increasingly sophisticated at detecting fake reviews. Getting caught results in penalties that can tank your listing.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Tracking What's Working</h2>

              <p>Your GBP dashboard gives you insights into how people are finding and interacting with your listing. Pay attention to:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Search queries:</strong> What people are typing to find you. This tells you which keywords are working and which ones you should target.</li>
                <li><strong>Photo views:</strong> How many people are looking at your photos. If views are low, your photos might need upgrading.</li>
                <li><strong>Direction requests:</strong> How many people are asking for directions to your location. This is the closest metric to actual foot traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Website clicks:</strong> How many people are clicking through to your site. If this number is low, your profile might need a stronger description or better call to action.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Your GBP Action Plan</h2>

              <p>Here's what to do this week:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Claim and verify your profile if you haven't already.</li>
                <li>Fill out every single field completely. No empty sections.</li>
                <li>Upload 10 or more high-quality photos of your space, food, and team.</li>
                <li>Write your first Google Post with a strong image and a clear CTA.</li>
                <li>Generate your review link and start sharing it with happy customers.</li>
                <li>Set a weekly reminder to publish a new post every Monday.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>This isn't complicated. It's just neglected. And because it's neglected, the bar is incredibly low. A few hours of setup and a few minutes per week will put you ahead of most hospitality businesses in Amsterdam.</p>
