              <p>Numbers without context are just decoration. Anyone can say "we grew a brand." So instead of just sharing the headline, we're going to show you exactly what we did, why we did it, and what we learned along the way.</p>

              <p>This is the full story of how we helped Oeuf Amsterdam, a trendy brunch restaurant in the heart of the city, more than double their Instagram following in six months.</p>

              <h2>Where Oeuf Started</h2>

              <p>When Oeuf came to us, they had around 4,000 Instagram followers. For a restaurant in Amsterdam, that's not bad. But their engagement was flat, and their growth had stalled. Here's what we found during our initial audit:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Inconsistent posting:</strong> Content was going out sporadically, sometimes three posts in a week, then nothing for two weeks. The algorithm punishes inconsistency.</li>
                <li><strong>No content strategy:</strong> Posts were a mix of food photos, reposted stories, and the occasional event announcement. There was no narrative thread tying it together.</li>
                <li><strong>Low shareability:</strong> The content looked decent but wasn't designed to be shared. No one was sending these posts to a friend saying "we need to go here."</li>
                <li><strong>Limited reach:</strong> Most impressions were coming from existing followers. The content wasn't reaching new audiences through Explore, Reels, or hashtags.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The fundamentals were there. Oeuf is a beautiful restaurant with great food and a strong visual identity. They didn't have a product problem. They had a storytelling problem.</p>

              <h2>The Strategy: Three Things We Changed</h2>

              <p>We didn't overhaul everything overnight. We focused on three specific changes that we believed would have the biggest impact.</p>

              <h3>1. A Consistent Content Calendar</h3>

              <p>We moved from random posting to a structured schedule: five posts per week, every week, without exception. Three feed posts and two Reels. We planned content a month in advance, mapped to themes and seasonal moments. This consistency alone sends a strong signal to Instagram's algorithm: this account is active and worth showing to people.</p>

              <h3>2. Content Designed to Be Shared</h3>

              <p>We shifted the content strategy from "showing the food" to "making people want to share the food." That sounds subtle, but it changes everything. Instead of a flat overhead shot of a plate, we created content that triggered an emotional response. A slow-motion pour of hollandaise over eggs Benedict. A Reel walking through the door into a sun-filled dining room. Close-ups that made you taste the food through your screen. Each piece of content was designed with one question in mind: would someone send this to a friend with the message "let's go here"?</p>

              <h3>3. Strategic Hashtag and Location Targeting</h3>

              <p>We rebuilt the hashtag strategy from scratch. Instead of generic tags like #food and #amsterdam, we targeted hyper-specific combinations: neighbourhood tags, cuisine-specific tags, and trending local tags. Combined with consistent location tagging and geo-targeted Stories, this dramatically expanded Oeuf's reach to people who were actually nearby and actually looking for brunch.</p>

              <h2>Month by Month</h2>

              <p><strong>Month 1 (Setup):</strong> Audit, strategy development, content calendar creation. We shot a library of content during two dedicated sessions at the restaurant. No visible growth yet, but the foundation was set.</p>

              <p><strong>Month 2:</strong> The consistent posting schedule kicked in. Follower growth started, slow but steady. Engagement rate began climbing as the algorithm started pushing content to Explore.</p>

              <p><strong>Month 3:</strong> First Reel broke 50,000 views. A slow-motion Dutch pancake video hit at the right time and brought in over 600 new followers in a single week. This proved the shareability strategy was working.</p>

              <p><strong>Month 4:</strong> Sustained growth as multiple Reels consistently reached 10,000 to 30,000 views. We doubled down on the content formats that were working: food close-ups, behind-the-scenes kitchen moments, and walk-in videos.</p>

              <p><strong>Month 5:</strong> Crossed 8,000 followers. Engagement rate hit its peak. Story replies and DMs from potential customers increased significantly. The restaurant noticed more people mentioning Instagram when they came in.</p>

              <p><strong>Month 6:</strong> Passed 10,000 followers. Organic reach was now 700% higher than when we started. The account had transformed from a static portfolio into an active, growing community.</p>

              <h2>The Numbers</h2>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Followers:</strong> 4,000 to 10,400 (+160%)</li>
                <li><strong>Organic reach:</strong> +700%</li>
                <li><strong>Average engagement rate:</strong> Rose from under 2% to over 5%</li>
                <li><strong>Content volume:</strong> From sporadic to 5x per week consistently</li>
                <li><strong>Best-performing Reel:</strong> 53,000+ views</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>What We Learned</h2>

              <p>Every project teaches you something. Here are the key takeaways from the Oeuf campaign:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistency beats creativity:</strong> A good post every day will outperform a brilliant post once a week. The algorithm rewards regular activity, and your audience learns to expect you in their feed.</li>
                <li><strong>Shareability is a design choice:</strong> You can intentionally create content that people want to send to others. It's not luck. It's a deliberate focus on emotional triggers: beauty, surprise, appetite, envy.</li>
                <li><strong>Local targeting works:</strong> Broad hashtags get lost in the noise. Neighbourhood-specific, cuisine-specific tags connect you with the people who are most likely to actually walk through your door.</li>
                <li><strong>The first month is setup:</strong> Don't expect instant results. The first four to six weeks are about building the foundation. Growth compounds after that.</li>
                <li><strong>Beautiful restaurants have an unfair advantage:</strong> If your space looks good, lean into it. Interior shots, natural light, the vibe of the room. These are assets that most brands would pay a fortune for, and you already have them.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Could This Work for Your Restaurant?</h2>

              <p>Honestly? It depends. Not every restaurant will see the same numbers. Oeuf had strong visual appeal and a product that photographs beautifully. But the principles are universal: post consistently, create shareable content, and target your local audience.</p>

              <p>If you're sitting on an Instagram account that's stuck, there's a good chance it's not a quality problem. It's a strategy problem. And strategy problems have solutions.</p>
