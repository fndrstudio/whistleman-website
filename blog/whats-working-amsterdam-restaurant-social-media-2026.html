            <article>

              <p>Every year, someone publishes a list of "social media trends" that reads like a tech conference agenda. AI this, VR that, the metaverse is coming.</p>

              <p>Let's skip that.</p>

              <p>If you're running a restaurant, bar, or caf&eacute; in Amsterdam, you don't need to know about the metaverse. You need to know what's making real people walk through real doors right now. So here's what we're seeing work, based on what we do every day for hospitality brands across the city.</p>

              <h2>Short-Form Video Is Non-Negotiable</h2>

              <p>This isn't new, but it's more true than ever. Reels on Instagram. Videos on TikTok. Shorts on YouTube. If you're not making short videos, you're invisible to the algorithm.</p>

              <p>The good news? The bar for restaurant video content is surprisingly low. You don't need a film crew. A 15-second clip of your chef plating a dish, shot on a phone with decent lighting, will outperform a perfectly designed static image almost every time.</p>

              <p>Here's what's working in short-form video right now:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Behind-the-scenes prep:</strong> Watching a bartender build a cocktail or a chef assemble a dish is inherently satisfying. These videos feel authentic and give people a reason to visit.</li>
                <li><strong>The reveal:</strong> A covered cloche lifted. A cocktail poured from height. A dessert broken open to show the inside. Anything that builds anticipation and delivers a visual payoff.</li>
                <li><strong>Staff personality:</strong> Your team is your brand. A barista doing a quick coffee tip, a waiter reacting to a customer's order, a chef explaining why they chose a particular ingredient. People follow people, not logos.</li>
                <li><strong>Time-lapses:</strong> The restaurant going from empty to full. A dish being built from raw ingredients. Your terrace transforming from morning calm to evening buzz. These take five minutes to set up and consistently perform well.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Instagram: Still the Main Course</h2>

              <p>Despite everything you've heard about Instagram being dead, it remains the primary platform for hospitality discovery in Amsterdam. The caveat is that the way people use Instagram has changed.</p>

              <p>In 2026, people are discovering restaurants through Reels and the Explore page, not through their feed. That means your content needs to be optimised for search and discovery, not just for your existing followers.</p>

              <p>Practical tips that are working right now:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Use location tags aggressively:</strong> Tag Amsterdam, tag your neighbourhood, tag the street. When someone explores "Jordaan" on Instagram, your content should show up.</li>
                <li><strong>Write captions with keywords:</strong> Instagram search is increasingly text-based. Include terms your audience is searching for: "brunch Amsterdam," "rooftop bar," "natural wine Oud-West."</li>
                <li><strong>Carousels for depth:</strong> When you have a story to tell, use carousels. A carousel showing the story behind a new menu item, the sourcing of ingredients, the inspiration — these get saved and shared at higher rates than single images.</li>
                <li><strong>Stories for daily connection:</strong> Use Stories to stay top of mind. Behind-the-scenes moments, polls about new menu items, quick updates about today's specials. Stories don't need to be polished. They need to be real.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>TikTok: Not Just for Dancing</h2>

              <p>TikTok is the fastest-growing discovery platform for dining. A single viral TikTok can fill your restaurant for weeks. We've seen it happen in Amsterdam.</p>

              <p>The key to TikTok for hospitality is understanding that people come to the platform to be entertained first and informed second. That means your content should be fun, visual, and quick. Nobody wants to watch a two-minute explanation of your farm-to-table philosophy. But they will watch a 15-second video of a cheese pull on a pizza that looks impossibly good.</p>

              <p>TikTok-specific strategies that work:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Hook in the first second:</strong> Start with the most visually compelling moment. If it's a dish, start with the close-up of the finished plate, not the chopping.</li>
                <li><strong>Use trending sounds:</strong> You don't have to do the dance. Just use the audio. A trending sound with a beautiful food shot gets algorithmic boost.</li>
                <li><strong>Lean into comments:</strong> TikTok's algorithm heavily rewards videos that generate comments. Ask questions. Make controversial statements about food. "Pineapple on pizza: yes or no?" is engagement gold.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>UGC: Your Guests Are Your Best Content Creators</h2>

              <p>User-generated content — posts that your customers create — is the most underused asset in hospitality marketing. When someone takes a photo of their food at your restaurant and posts it, that's an authentic endorsement that no amount of branded content can replicate.</p>

              <p>How to encourage more UGC:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Make your space Instagram-worthy:</strong> This isn't about being gimmicky. Good lighting, attractive plating, and one or two "wow" visual elements in your interior naturally encourage photos.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a branded hashtag:</strong> Something simple and easy to remember. Feature the best posts on your own feed. When people know they might get reposted, they put more effort into their content.</li>
                <li><strong>Repost with credit:</strong> Sharing your guests' content builds community and gives you a steady stream of authentic content without lifting a finger.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>The Amsterdam Factor</h2>

              <p>Amsterdam's hospitality scene has a unique character that should inform your social media strategy. Some things that play especially well here:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Canal views and terraces:</strong> Seasonal terrace content does incredibly well. The first sunny day on your Herengracht terrace? Post it immediately. That content travels.</li>
                <li><strong>International audience:</strong> Amsterdam attracts visitors from everywhere. Post in English. Use location-based hashtags that tourists search for.</li>
                <li><strong>Neighbourhood identity:</strong> De Pijp, Jordaan, Oost, Noord — each neighbourhood has its own vibe and its own following online. Lean into your local identity. People search for "best coffee Oud-West," not just "best coffee Amsterdam."</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability and local sourcing:</strong> Amsterdam diners care about where their food comes from. If you're working with local suppliers or have sustainable practices, talk about it. It resonates here more than in most cities.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>What's Not Working Anymore</h2>

              <p>A few things you can stop doing:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Overly polished studio content:</strong> People scroll past anything that looks like an ad. Authenticity outperforms perfection.</li>
                <li><strong>Posting once a week and hoping for the best:</strong> The algorithm rewards consistency. Three times a week minimum, daily if you can manage it.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring comments and DMs:</strong> If someone takes the time to message you and gets no response, you've lost a customer. Social media is a two-way conversation.</li>
                <li><strong>Relying on hashtags alone:</strong> Hashtags still help, but they're no longer the primary discovery mechanism. Focus on Reels, SEO-optimised captions, and location tags instead.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Your 2026 Game Plan</h2>

              <p>If you take nothing else from this post, take this: the restaurants and bars winning on social media in Amsterdam right now are the ones creating short, authentic video content consistently. They're not spending thousands on production. They're pulling out their phone, capturing real moments, and posting them regularly.</p>

              <p>That's it. No fancy strategy. No expensive equipment. Just consistency, authenticity, and a willingness to show what makes your place special.</p>

              <p>The bar is low. The opportunity is high. Your move.</p>
