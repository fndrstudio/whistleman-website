            <article>

              <p>Let's address the elephant in the room. You've been thinking about hiring someone to handle your social media. Maybe you've even reached out to a few agencies. And every single one of them said the same thing: "it depends."</p>

              <p>Helpful, right?</p>

              <p>We get it. Pricing in this industry is about as transparent as a fogged-up kitchen window. So we're going to do something that most Amsterdam agencies won't: give you actual numbers, real context, and a framework to figure out what makes sense for your business.</p>

              <h2>The Short Answer</h2>

              <p>Social media management in Amsterdam typically costs between &euro;500 and &euro;3,000 per month, depending on what's included. That's a wide range, so let's break it down.</p>

              <p>A solo freelancer handling your Instagram two or three times a week might charge &euro;500 to &euro;800 a month. A mid-tier agency running your full social presence, including content creation, strategy, and community management, will land somewhere between &euro;1,000 and &euro;2,500. And if you want the full package with photography, video production, influencer management, and multi-platform coverage, you're looking at &euro;2,500 and up.</p>

              <p>But cost alone doesn't tell you much. What matters is what you're actually getting.</p>

              <h2>What Are You Actually Paying For?</h2>

              <p>When you hire an agency or freelancer for social media management, you're typically paying for some combination of these things:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Strategy and planning:</strong> Defining your brand voice, content pillars, target audience, and posting schedule. This is the foundation that makes everything else work.</li>
                <li><strong>Content creation:</strong> Photography, video, graphic design, copywriting. This is usually the most time-intensive part and where quality varies the most.</li>
                <li><strong>Scheduling and publishing:</strong> Actually getting the content live at the right times, on the right platforms, with the right captions and hashtags.</li>
                <li><strong>Community management:</strong> Responding to comments, DMs, reviews, and mentions. Building relationships with your audience, not just broadcasting at them.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting and optimisation:</strong> Tracking what's working, what's not, and adjusting the strategy accordingly.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The problem is that some agencies include all of this in their monthly fee, while others charge separately for photography, video, or strategy. So comparing prices without comparing scope is like comparing a rijsttafel to a single dish. The price difference makes sense when you see what's on the table.</p>

              <h2>The Three Routes: DIY, Freelancer, or Agency</h2>

              <h3>Route 1: Doing It Yourself</h3>

              <p><strong>Monthly cost:</strong> &euro;0 to &euro;200 (tools and ads only)<br>
              <strong>Time investment:</strong> 8 to 15 hours per week</p>

              <p>The cheapest option in euros, the most expensive in time. If you're running a restaurant in De Pijp and spending three hours a day on Instagram instead of perfecting your menu, you're losing money you can't see on a spreadsheet. DIY works when you're just starting out and have more time than budget. But there's a ceiling to how far it can take you, especially when the algorithm rewards consistency and quality.</p>

              <h3>Route 2: Hiring a Freelancer</h3>

              <p><strong>Monthly cost:</strong> &euro;500 to &euro;1,200<br>
              <strong>What you get:</strong> Usually content creation and scheduling for one or two platforms</p>

              <p>Freelancers are great for specific tasks. Need someone to shoot your dishes once a month and schedule posts? A freelancer can handle that. But most freelancers specialise in one thing. They might be an excellent photographer but not a strategist. Or a great copywriter who doesn't touch video. You'll likely need to manage them yourself, and if they get sick or go on holiday, your feed goes dark.</p>

              <h3>Route 3: Working With an Agency</h3>

              <p><strong>Monthly cost:</strong> &euro;1,000 to &euro;3,000+<br>
              <strong>What you get:</strong> End-to-end management: strategy, creation, publishing, community, reporting</p>

              <p>An agency brings a team. That means a strategist, content creator, copywriter, and community manager all working on your brand. You get consistency, reliability, and expertise across multiple disciplines. The trade-off is a higher monthly cost. But when you look at the cost per hour of work delivered, agencies often end up being more cost-effective than you'd expect, because the work is split across specialists who move faster in their lane.</p>

              <h2>The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About</h2>

              <p>Every pricing conversation should include these often-overlooked expenses:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Photography and video shoots:</strong> Some agencies include monthly content shoots. Others charge &euro;300 to &euro;800 per shoot on top of the management fee. Always ask.</li>
                <li><strong>Ad spend:</strong> Your management fee covers the work. It doesn't cover ad spend. If you want to boost posts or run paid campaigns, budget an additional &euro;200 to &euro;1,000 per month, depending on your goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform fees and tools:</strong> Scheduling tools, analytics platforms, stock assets. These typically run &euro;50 to &euro;150 per month. Most agencies absorb these costs, but not all.</li>
                <li><strong>Onboarding time:</strong> The first month with any agency is a ramp-up period. Don't expect immediate results. Budget for the learning curve.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How to Know If You're Getting Your Money's Worth</h2>

              <p>Here's a simple framework. After three months of working with an agency, ask yourself these five questions:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Is my content visibly better than what I was posting before?</li>
                <li>Am I getting more engagement (likes, comments, saves, shares) than I was?</li>
                <li>Are people finding my business through social media (new followers, DMs, website clicks)?</li>
                <li>Am I spending less personal time on social media than before?</li>
                <li>Do I feel confident that my brand is being represented well?</li>
              </ul>

              <p>If you can answer yes to at least four of those, you're probably getting good value. If you're answering no to most of them after three months, it's time for a conversation with your agency, or a new one.</p>

              <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

              <p>Social media management isn't cheap, but doing it badly is more expensive. A dead feed, inconsistent branding, and missed opportunities cost you in ways that don't show up on an invoice.</p>

              <p>The right investment depends on where your business is right now. Just opened a new spot on the Herengracht? You might need the full agency treatment to build momentum. Running a neighbourhood favourite in the Jordaan with a loyal local crowd? A freelancer keeping your feed alive might be all you need.</p>

              <p>Whatever route you choose, the most important thing is this: ask the right questions, compare scope (not just price), and make sure whoever you hire actually understands hospitality. Because someone who's great at marketing SaaS products will struggle to make your signature dish look irresistible at 11 PM on a Tuesday.</p>
